# Citation Metrics
## Introduction

The goal of this project is to build citation metrics for an astronomer (or a group of astronomers) using data from the [adsabs](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/) website in SQL format. In this project we use the adsabs APIs designed to load the data that required to build SQL tables and subsequent queries.
