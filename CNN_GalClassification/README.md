# Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for galaxy morphological classification

In this project we are going to use CNN to provide the morphological classification of galaxies including in the SDSS survey (Sloan Digital Sky Survey). These galaxies have been classified morphologically using the [GalaxyZoo](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zookeeper/galaxy-zoo/) plataform. 
This project make use of the images reprocessed by the  [`astroNN`](wwww) package.
